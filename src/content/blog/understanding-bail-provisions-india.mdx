## What is Bail?

Bail is the conditional release of an accused person awaiting trial, typically requiring a sum of money or property as security. In India, the right to bail is a fundamental aspect of criminal jurisprudence, balancing the presumption of innocence with the need to ensure the accused's appearance at trial.

## Types of Bail in India

### 1. Regular Bail

Regular bail is granted to a person who is already in custody. It is applied for under **Section 437 and 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)**. The court considers several factors:

- Nature and severity of the offense
- Criminal history of the accused
- Possibility of tampering with evidence
- Risk of fleeing from justice

### 2. Anticipatory Bail

Anticipatory bail can be sought **before arrest** under Section 438 of CrPC. This is particularly useful when:

- There's a genuine apprehension of arrest
- The allegations appear to be frivolous or motivated
- The applicant has a clean record

### 3. Interim Bail

Interim bail is temporary bail granted for a short period, usually until the regular bail application is decided.

## Bailable vs Non-Bailable Offenses

**Bailable Offenses:**
- Bail is a matter of right
- Police can grant bail at the station
- Examples: Minor theft, assault causing simple hurt

**Non-Bailable Offenses:**
- Bail is at court's discretion
- Application must be made before a Magistrate or Judge
- Examples: Murder, rape, kidnapping
